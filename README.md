## About Me

I am Mohammed Ahmed, a Medical Laboratory Technician with a keen interest in data analysis. I hold a Biomedical Science degree and am certified as an IBM Data Science Professional. Presently, I am employed in the Biochemistry department at QML Pathology as a Medical Laboratory Technician.
